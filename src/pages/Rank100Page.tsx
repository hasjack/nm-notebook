        k = 98 took 21 minutes to a nine-digit factor larger than B, so the
        thin sieve never saw it. k = 100 took 48 minutes (factor 393061223).
        Several later k die in a fraction of a second on a tiny prime. k = 104
        returned composite in 0.28 s with no factor stored in the walker JSON.
        The FFT PRP never started on any of these. A 40-hour gmpy2 Fermat on
        the Studio was the k = 98 check without the trial-factor gate.
