        k = 98 took 21 minutes to a nine-digit factor larger than B, so the
        thin sieve never saw it. k = 100 took 48 minutes (factor 393061223).
        Several later k die in a fraction of a second on a tiny prime. k = 104
        returned composite in 0.28 s with no factor stored in the walker JSON.
        The FFT PRP never started on k = 98–122. k = 124 has been in PFGW for
        18 h 48 m and counting, well past the ~4 h trial-factor bound to
        1.66×10<sup>9</sup>, so this is the first candidate that may be in the
        1344K FFT. No <code>k124.log</code> until it exits (stdout is
        captured). A 40-hour gmpy2 Fermat on the Studio was the k = 98 check
        without the trial-factor gate.
